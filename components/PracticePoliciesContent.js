        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Risks &amp; Benefits of Therapy</h2>
        <p>
          You have taken a courageous step by deciding to seek therapy. The outcome of your treatment depends largely on your willingness to engage in this process, which may, at times, result in considerable discomfort. It may also result in the benefit of reducing negative symptoms, increasing purpose and fulfillment, enhancing relationships, discovering balance, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remembering unpleasant events and becoming aware of feelings attached to those events can bring on strong feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, etc. Often times, clients feel that they may get worse before they get better, which can be a normal response, as creating change can be difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot promise that your behavior or circumstance will change. However, I can promise to support you, do my best to understand your needs, and help you reach your treatment goals. At times, I may challenge you or try to offer a different perspective to promote growth and balance. Clients should address any concerns they have regarding their progress in treatment with the therapist.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
          The session content and all relevant materials to the client’s treatment will be held confidential unless the client requests in writing to have all or portions of such content released to a specifically named person/persons. Limitations of such client held privilege of confidentiality exist and are itemized below:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-3 space-y-1 text-gray-800">
          <li>If a client threatens or attempts to commit suicide or otherwise conducts him/her self in a manner in which there is a substantial risk of incurring serious bodily harm.</li>
          <li>If a client threatens grave bodily harm or death to another person.</li>
          <li>If the therapist has a reasonable suspicion that a client or other named victim is the perpetrator, observer of, or actual victim of physical, emotional or sexual abuse of children under the age of 18 years.</li>
          <li>Suspicions as stated above in the case of an elderly person who may be subjected to these abuses.</li>
          <li>Suspected neglect of the parties named in items #3 and #4.</li>
          <li>If a court of law issues a legitimate subpoena for information stated on the subpoena.</li>
          <li>If a client is in therapy or being treated by order of a court of law, or if information is obtained for the purpose of rendering an expert’s report to an attorney.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Occasionally I may need to consult with other professionals in their areas of expertise in order to provide the best treatment for you. Information about you may be shared in this context without using your name.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we see each other accidentally outside of the therapy office, I will not acknowledge you first. Your right to privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to me, and I do not wish to jeopardize your privacy. However, if you acknowledge me first, I will be more than happy to speak briefly with you, but feel it appropriate not to engage in any lengthy discussions in public or outside of the therapy office.
